There is a draft instruction on compiling NDN murmur.

The default setting now is to compile murmur only (server only, no client), without ice support.

We assume you install your ccnx code to /usr/local, otherwise you may need to modify and LIBPATH and INCLUDEPATH in murmur.pro. 

For Debain/Ubuntu user, the following command will make sure you have the needed libraries and dependencies:
apt-get install qt4-dev-tools libqt4-dev libboost-dev \
				libssl-dev g++ \
				libpulse-dev libcap-dev  \
				libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler  \
				libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev libsndfile1-dev libxi-dev

And yes, some of them are not necessary as they are only for Mumble client. We will take them off in the next release.

Now type the following command to compile murmur:
qmake main.pro -recursive
make  

For Mac OS X user, we also have a pre-built build environment for you:
http://www.scorpius-project.org/mumble-osx-dev/MumbleDeveloper.tar.bz2

Unarchive it to your / (root directory).
To set up your environment for a build, execute
source /MumbleDeveloper/bin/mumble-x86-64-build-env

now type the following command to compile murmur:
qmake main.pro -recursive
make

If you want to build the dependency by yourself, you can refer to:
http://mumble.sourceforge.net/BuildingMacOSX

Note that if you encounter problem with "lipo", try to the following:
rm `find . -name "Makefile*"` 
qmake -config no-universal -recursive main.pro

If you are compiling against the ports openssl for the code, you have to compile your ccnx against the same (version of) openssl.

(Thanks to Nick Briggs for reporting these tips)
